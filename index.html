        <h1>All About Black Holes!</h1>


        <h2>Introdcution:</h2>
        <p>The universe is exspansive and ever-growing. As hard as one tries to understand all of it, there's just so much left to discover and discuss. Although, one of the greater mysteries of the universe is that of <strong>Black Holes</strong>. This webpage will explain what we already know about black holes, and leave you wanting to learn more about space well beyond the confines of out solar system.</p>
        <br>


        <h3>What are Black Holes?</h3>
        <p>Black Holes are defined as regions in space that have a gravitational field so immense that no matter, including light, can escape.</p>
        <br>


        <h3>How do Black Holes Work?</h3>
        <p>Black Holes pull in and consume everything around them due to their massive gravitational force. Contrary to popular belief, black holes don't consume matter very quickly. Just like a star, matter orbits around them gradually getting closer and closer to their <em>event horizon</em>. An event horizon is a theoretical boundary around a black hole that once matter and light passes it can never escape. This means that when matter and light pass the event horizon they are now a part of the black hole.</p>
        <br>


        <h3>How are Black Holes Formed?</h3>
        <p>They are formed in two different ways. The first way is when a star, with enough mass, reaches the end of it's life and explodes in an event called a supernova. Some stars aren't massive enough to become black holes, so they just explode. Stars that are big enough, those with a mass at least 8-10 times that of our sun, form a black hole. This kind of black hole is reffered to as a <em>Stellar Mass Black Hole</em>.</p>
        <p>The second way is when gas in space, also called interstellar gas, collapses. This collapse happens due to the gravitational force exerted from enough interstellar gas being clumped close enough together. This yields are larger kind of black hole, ones that can be anywhere from 1,000-100,000 times the mass of our sun. These are called <em>Supermassive Black Holes</em>. This kind of black hole was more commonly formed in the early stages of the universe, although it can still happen now.</p>

                <td>100-1,000 Solar Masses</td>
                <td>Intermediate-Mass</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1,000-100,000 Solar Masses</td>
                <td>Supermassive</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Where Can Black Holes Be Found?</h3>
        <p>Black holes can be found everywhere in the universe. Some are at the center of galaxies, like Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole at the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Some are rogue, scattered throughout galaxies or just sitting alone in the universe. Some black holes even have planets orbiting around them, just like how there are planets orbiting our sun. These planets are called <em>Blanets</em>, a combination of the words <em>Black Hole</em> and <em>Planet</em>.</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The "rings" around black holes don't actually exist. The gravitational force exerted by the black hole bends light, time and space around it. This makes it appear like the <em>Accretion Disk</em>, the light, gas and other matter orbiting the black hole, wraps around the black hole like Saturn's rings.</li>
            <li><em>Spaghettification</em> is the process of matter getting stretched out when it passes through the event horizon.</li>
            <li>Over <strong>very</strong> long periods of time, black holes will "evaporate" by returning the energy they use and absorb to the universe via a process called <em>Hawking Radiation</em>.</li>
            <li>Black holes are both visible and invisible. They can't be seen with the naked eye, but the effects that they have on the surronding space and matter can be seen, this is also how we detect black holes.</li>
            <li>Not only can black holes get bigger by consuming matter and light, but also by merging with other black holes.</li>
            <li>Black holes make noise. They make a sort of gurgling sound when matter passes through their event horizons.</li>
        </ul>
